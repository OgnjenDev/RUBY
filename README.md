# 🔴 Ruby OS

**Ruby OS** is a retro-style, Python-based simulated operating system that mimics the behavior of real-world OS environments while running entirely in a terminal or basic graphical interface. It's lightweight, fun, and educational — perfect for learning how operating systems work or building your own software inside a safe, customizable shell.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Ruby OS is not a true low-level operating system. It runs on top of Python and is a simulation intended for learning and experimentation.

## 🚀 Overview

Ruby OS features a fully interactive Python-powered shell environment, complete with:

- A **custom bootloader simulation** (`EBOOT.py`)
- Core apps like **Notepad**, **Paint**, and a **Terminal**
- File and user space management
- A modular, folder-based architecture
- Built-in support for user extensions, games, and scripting

Ruby OS is designed for old-school computing lovers, young developers, and hobbyists who want to **build**, **break**, and **tinker**.
